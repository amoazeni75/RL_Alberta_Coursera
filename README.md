<h1>Reinforcement Learning Specialization</h1>
<p>Master the Concepts of Reinforcement Learning. Implement a complete RL solution and understand how to apply AI tools to solve real-world problems.</p>
<p>The Reinforcement Learning Specialization consists of 4 courses exploring the power of adaptive learning systems and artificial intelligence (AI).

Harnessing the full potential of artificial intelligence requires adaptive learning systems. Learn how Reinforcement Learning (RL) solutions help solve real-world problems through trial-and-error interaction by implementing a complete RL solution from beginning to end.</p>
